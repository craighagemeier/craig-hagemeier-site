  "The work I do for clients? Pixel-perfect. But this site? Not so much. This is a playground. A place to experiment, break things, and test ideas â€” some good, some questionable. The Kruger theme? Fun, but chaotic. The Rogue Coast glassmorphism theme? Stylish, but an accessibility nightmare. (You can try them both using the ðŸŽ¨ icon in the header.)",

  "I'm an advocate of great design, clean code, and systems that scale. I've built two full-scale design systems in my career, and I'm always thinking about the next one. But this site isn't about polished case studies or perfect portfolios. It's a space to tinker, create, and see what happens.",

  "Because nothing is ever truly finished â€” not the work we do, not the things we build, not even ourselves. We're all a work in progress, shaping and reshaping every day. That's both the challenge and the reward, because who we are is always ours to create."

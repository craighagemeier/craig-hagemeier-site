  "The work I do for clients? Pixel-perfect. But this site? Not so much. This is a playground. A place to experiment, break things, and test ideas â€” some good, some questionable. The Kruger theme? Fun, but chaotic. The Rogue Coast glassmorphism theme? Stylish, but an accessibility nightmare. (You can try them both using the ðŸŽ¨ icon in the header.)",
  "PARAGRAPH_BREAK",
  "I'm an advocate of great design, clean code, and systems that scale. I've built two full-scale design systems in my career, and I'm always thinking about the next one. But this site isn't about polished case studies or perfect portfolios. It's a space to tinker, create, and see what happens.",

  "So feel free to explore. Check out my latest photos. See what endurance challenge I'm working on. Get inspired to make something. Capture something. Go somewhere new. Push yourself.",
  "PARAGRAPH_BREAK",
  "Because nothing is ever truly finished â€” not the work we do, not the things we build, not even ourselves. We're all a work in progress, shaping and reshaping every day. That's both the challenge and the reward, because who we are is always ours to create."
